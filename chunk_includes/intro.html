<p>
In order to participate in this experiment, you need to be a native speaker of American English (i.e. you must have moved to the U.S. before the age of 6 and you must have lived there most of your life). Thank you for participating in this study.</p>

<p>
You will read sentence which were extracted and transcribed from dialogues on various topics, such as politics, family life, movies, etc. Since the sentences are drawn from natural conversations, some of them may be fragments or they may contain transcribed disfluencies, as in "And, he was like, uh, from Portland.". Sentences will be presented word-by-word. You will advance through sentences by pressing the SPACE bar.</p>

<p>
We are interested in how fast these sentences can be read while you still understand them. That's why about half of the sentences will be followed by content questions about them. Try to answer those questions as fast as possible but also as accurately as possible (to the best of your abilities). You can answer "yes" by pressing 1 and answer "no" by pressing 2 (you will be reminded of that every time you see a question).</p>

<p>
Don't worry, before the real experiment starts you will go through four practice trials.</p>

<p>
At the end of the experiment you will be given a code to paste into the HIT on Mechanical Turk to verify that you completed the experiment.</p>

<p>
Feedback about the experiment is always welcome. Thank you for helping us understand the cognitive processes involved in reading.
